This repo reproduces a bug in [vektra/mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery).

## Prerequisites
* Windows operating system
* mockery v3 in your PATH

## Steps to reproduce
1. Clone the project and navigate to the project directory.
1. In the terminal, run `mockery`

## Actual result
A file `sample_mock.go` is generated with the following header:

```go
// Code generated by mockery; DO NOT EDIT.
// github.com/vektra/mockery
// template: testify

package main

import (
	"github.com/davidbacisin/mockery-bug"
	mock "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)
```

Note that it is importing the main package into itself, resulting in an import cycle.

By running `mockery --log-level 0`, we can see the problem:

```log
2025-05-06T13:55:50.517813800-07:00 DBG path does not equal dst-pkg-path, adding import dst-pkg-path="github.com\\davidbacisin\\mockery-bug" file=sample_mock.go interface-name=Sample method=AddImport mock-name=MockSample package-path=github.com/davidbacisin/mockery-bug schema=testify.schema.json src-pkg-path=github.com/davidbacisin/mockery-bug template=testify version=v3.2.5
```

Because `dst-pkg-path` uses backslashes and `src-pkg-path` uses forward slashes, the path strings are not equal.
The generator thus imports the package into itself.

## Expected result
A file `sample_mock.go` should be generated with a header similar to the following:

```go
// Code generated by mockery; DO NOT EDIT.
// github.com/vektra/mockery
// template: testify

package main

import (
	mock "github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)
```
